## Summary

In this project, I aimed to apply the things I've learned on neural networks onto a database of handwritten digits taken by [Kaggle's digit recognizer database](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer). I was able to explore more of the mathematics behind deep neural nets such as Stochastic Gradient Descent, and the importance of cross-validating in order to improve recognition accuracy.
